# Visionary

A copy of visionary that adds scuffed effects to be viewed in the editor. Its not 1:1 and expect things to not to be 1:1. But this serves as a quicker way of adding effects to moves
---
Visionary is a desktop editor for viewing and editing most things about fighters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, except for models and animations. Changes are previewed in the running game through the included Skyline plugin.

## Components

- `src/` contains the desktop application.
- `plugins/slight_replica/` contains the in-game effect viewer and live-edit plugin.
- The upstream `ssbh_wgpu` crate provides character model, animation, skeleton,
  and weapon rendering.
- The [`effect_library`](https://crates.io/crates/effect_library) crate on
  crates.io provides `.eff` parsing, editing, and export.
- The effect editor exposes the documented emitter, particle, animation,
  rendering, sampler, shader, and spawn settings described by
  [EffectResearch](https://github.com/LilyLavender/EffectResearch).

## Prerequisites

- A recent Rust toolchain
- The `cargo-skyline` toolchain for building the in-game plugin

Cargo downloads the pinned `ssbh_wgpu` revision, `effect_library`, and the other
Rust dependencies automatically during the build.

## Game data

Use ArcExplorer to dump the `fighter` and `effect` folders from your
`data.arc`. The `data.arc` file is located in the game's RomFS.

Keep the dumped folders beneath the same export root:

```text
ArcExplorer export/
├── fighter/
├── effect/
└── ui/        (optional — needed for the Roster window)
```

Open this export root in Visionary when prompted. The `fighter` folder provides
character models, motion data, and parameters; the `effect` folder provides the
`.eff` files used by the effect editor.

The `ui` folder is optional and only the Roster window needs it. Dump it if you
want to edit the character select screen: it provides
`ui/param/database/ui_chara_db.prc` (the roster database, which decides who
appears on the select screen and in what order), `ui/message/` (display names),
and the character portraits. Visionary looks for it in the export root first and
then in each enabled mod root in load order, so a mod that ships its own roster
database is picked up without any extra configuration. Without a `ui` folder,
every other part of the editor works normally and the character select tab says
what is missing.

The viewport follows each motion list's animation references across the fighter's
motion parts. This includes Kirby copy-ability animations stored in donor body
directories, so copied specials preview with their intended animation when the
corresponding files are present in the export.

## Roster

The **Roster** window (Windows → Roster, or File → Mod Library) covers everything about a
fighter that is not one move.

### Mod library

Import compiled mods — folders, or `.zip` and `.7z` archives, many at once. Visionary finds
the game folders inside whatever wrapper a mod ships with (`romfs/`, a folder named after the
mod, and so on) and says which level it chose. Each mod can be enabled, renamed, and moved in
load order; **later mods win** any file an earlier one also provides, and every such conflict
is listed per fighter with the winner named.

Mods that ship a compiled `.nro` plugin are flagged: Visionary cannot read compiled plugin
code, so for those fighters what the editor shows is the vanilla script rather than what the
mod does.

Archives are extracted into Visionary's cache. Folders are used in place, so a mod folder you
maintain yourself stays live as you edit it.

### Character select

Needs the game's `ui/` folder dumped alongside `fighter/` and `effect/`. Shows the roster as a
grid of portraits in the game's own order, with modded and authored characters marked. Drag a
portrait onto another to move it; hide a character and restore it later. Every change is stored
as a sparse override, so exporting rebuilds the roster database from whatever base file is
installed rather than from a copy taken when you made the edit.

Positions come from `disp_order` in `ui/param/database/ui_chara_db.prc`. The column count in
the preview is a display choice — the game's own grid geometry lives in its layout files, which
Visionary does not read. What the preview is authoritative about is the order.

### New character

Adds a character as a **costume of an existing fighter**. It gets its own model, animations,
effects, display name, and moveset, and you select it by choosing that fighter and then its
costume. It does not get its own square on the select screen; see `docs/roster/PLAN.md` for the
measurement behind that.

Creating one makes the folders your model and animations go in and adds them to the mod
library, so the slot is editable immediately. The panel reports what is still missing —
including animation files that no motion list names, which are present but will never play.

Turn on **Edit this character's moves** and the moves you edit in the main window belong to
that costume. The exported plugin gates them, so the donor's other costumes keep their own
version of everything you change. If Visionary does not have the fighter's original script for
a move you scoped, the export stops and says so rather than shipping a plugin that removes that
move from every other costume.

### Traits

Weight, gravity, walk and run speeds, jump heights, landing lag, shield size, and the rest, from
`fighter/common/param/fighter_param.prc`. Grouped and explained, with every field reachable
behind a full list, and the base value shown beside anything you change.

These values are stored per fighter and **not** per costume — there is no per-costume version of
any of them. A costume-backed character therefore shares all of them with its donor, and the
editor says so.

### Applying and exporting

**Apply to game** writes the roster and value changes into the game's mod folder. They are read
when the character select screen or a fighter loads, so back out to the select screen to see
them; they do not change mid-match. Exporting a mod folder writes them alongside the ACMD and
effect files, in one report — anything that could not be written is named rather than dropped.

## Desktop editor

Build Visionary from the repository root with the script for your platform.

Windows:

```bat
build.bat --release
```

Linux:

```bash
bash build.sh --release
```

The Linux script also registers the application launcher and scalable icon in
the current user's desktop environment. Set `VISIONARY_SKIP_DESKTOP_INSTALL=1`
to build without updating that launcher. For development, run Visionary with
`cargo run`. Visionary's application ID matches the installed desktop entry so
Wayland compositors can resolve the icon normally; the icon is also embedded in
the executable for native window decorations on Windows and X11.

Visionary reads the dumped data from its existing location and remembers the
selected export root for future sessions.

### Editing a move

The main window keeps editing tasks in one focused inspector. Select a move in
the Fighters list, then use the tabs beside the viewport:

- **Collisions** contains attacks, grabs, wind, throw-damage, and active-hitbox
  data. Common values are shown first; **Hit behavior**, **Valid targets**, **Hit
  feedback**, and other less-used fields stay in clearly named collapsible sections.
- **Hurtboxes** contains parameter-defined capsules, `HIT_NODE`/`HIT_NO`/
  `WHOLE_HIT` state changes, invincibility and intangibility ranges, and
  damage-reaction armor settings.
- **Motion & state** contains facing, velocity, kinetic, animation-timing,
  ground/air, and stored script-state commands.
- **Sound & feedback** contains move sounds, camera shake, controller rumble,
  and supported expression-script animation controls.
- **Visual effects** contains particle spawns, trails, model or screen colour
  changes, and effect-control commands from the move's `effect_` script. An
  effect that ends at a finite frame also shows the two **End flags** its
  `EFFECT_OFF_KIND` was written with; the vanilla scripts do not agree on them,
  so they are carried per call rather than defaulted.

Section names use plain language first and show the native macro name where it
matters. Hover any section name to see what it controls, including engine terms
such as **Work flags** and **kinetic energy**.

The timeline below the viewport is a shared view of every loaded category.
Collision and hurtbox events have separate **Collisions** and **Hurtboxes**
filters, so you can hide one without hiding the other. Click a row or its bar
to select the item and seek to its first game frame; click empty space to scrub.
Category filters are manual and remembered between sessions. Game frames are
one-based, matching the frame numbers used by the editor and the source
scripts.

Edits preview immediately. **Undo** and **Redo** apply to the current move and
remain available when you switch moves during the session. **Restore move**
discards the current move's staged collision, motion, effect, sound, and
expression edits and reloads the loaded source or capture baseline.

To hide a fighter from the sidebar, right-click its name and choose **Forget
fighter**. Visionary removes that fighter's cached scripts, saved edits, and
live effect previews while leaving the dumped and mod files unchanged. Use the
**Restore** button beside the Fighters heading to show forgotten fighters
again.

## Eden emulator setup

Visionary's live preview workflow uses the latest [Eden Nightly
build](https://eden-emu.dev/downloads/). On the download page, select the
**Nightly** channel and download the build for your operating system and CPU.
Eden Nightly changes frequently, so update to the newest build before
troubleshooting a connection problem.

Configure Eden's network interface before starting the game:

1. Open **Configure → System → Network** in Eden.
2. Set **Network Interface** to the active network card used by the computer,
   such as the connected Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter. Do not leave the interface
   unselected.
3. Apply the setting, then start or restart the game.

The network-interface setting is required for the in-game plugin to expose its
connection to Visionary. The editor connects automatically when Eden and
Visionary are running on the same computer.

## In-game plugin

Build the Skyline plugin with the script for your platform.

Windows:

```bat
plugins\slight_replica\scripts\build.bat
```

Linux:

```bash
bash plugins/slight_replica/scripts/build.sh
```

The resulting `lib_effect_viewer.nro` is written beneath
`plugins/slight_replica/target/aarch64-skyline-switch/release/`. See the
[plugin guide](plugins/slight_replica/README.md) for deployment, runtime
dependencies, and live-edit setup.

Visionary finds standard Eden, yuzu, and Ryujinx SD-card locations through the
host operating system's application-data directories. For a portable or custom
emulator installation, set `VISIONARY_SD_DIR` to the emulator SD root before
starting Visionary. `VISIONARY_CACHE_DIR` can similarly move Visionary's cache
and temporary workspace to another location.

## Your own ACMD source

By default Visionary reads ACMD scripts from an online archive of the *vanilla*
scripts. If you have already modded a move, that is not the code your game runs.

Open **Windows → ACMD Source** and link the Rust project that builds your
plugin — the folder holding its `Cargo.toml`. Visionary recursively scans its
Rust source files, so scripts can stay in their existing modules and filenames;
you do not need to create a specially named aggregate file. It joins
registrations with functions even when they live in different source files and
reads the selected move from the original functions, so the editor shows the
macros you actually called. Both the smashline layout (`Agent::new("mario")`
beside the scripts) and the older `#[acmd_script(agent = "…", script = "…")]`
attributes are recognised.

A project rarely overrides everything, and it does not have to. Each category is
resolved on its own: your `game_attackairn` is used for the hitboxes, and the
move's stock effects and sounds still come from the vanilla scripts, so a mod
that only retimes a hitbox does not make the move look silent and effectless.
Anything your project does define always wins over the vanilla copy.

The same window edits a script in place: pick **Hitboxes** or **Effects** to
open that function in a small text editor. Saving needs the function to exist in
your project — Visionary will not invent a place to put an effect you edited but
never wrote.

The editor and the rest of the app stay in sync both ways while you work:

- Typing in the source updates the timeline, the viewport, and the live game
  preview as soon as the text settles. Half-finished code is ignored rather than
  blanking the panels, and the last readable version stays on screen.
- Dragging a value in the editor panels writes it straight back into the source
  text, so the code always shows what you are looking at.

Nothing touches the file on disk until you press **Save**, which rewrites only
that one function in the source file that owns it and leaves the rest of the
project alone. If the same fighter and script name appears in more than one
function, Visionary reports the conflicting files and functions instead of
guessing which one to edit; resolve the duplicate and press **Rescan**.
**Revert** restores the script as loaded, panels included.

**Show** switches between your source, the code Visionary *would* write into
`acmd_source/` if you exported the move right now, and both side by side. The
generated pane runs the real export emitter on the move as it currently stands,
so it is exactly what you would get — not an approximation of it. If a spawn
cannot be exported under the macro your script used, it says which one and why.

The generated pane does not need a linked project, and works for any move the
editor has loaded — including one captured live from the game, which has no
script file anywhere. That case is the reason it is worth having.

### Checking the generated code

Under that pane is the result of the same check every export runs. It does not
ask the emitter what it meant to write. It reads the generated code back with the
parser the editor uses on your own scripts, and compares what comes out with the
move on screen — every field of every collision and spawn, by name.

Five things are checked. The first three stop an export rather than warn about
it, because a mod that does not build, or that quietly ships numbers other than
the ones you set, is worse than no mod:

- **It is Rust.** Every generated file is parsed. Lines kept verbatim from your
  script, and recorded macro tails, are spliced into the output as they are, so
  this is not a formality.
- **It says what you said.** A single rounded decimal is a failure. Exports used
  to write collision values to one decimal place, so a vanilla `0.35` hitbox
  attribute shipped as `0.3`, and a grab box at `-17.25` as `-17.2`, with nothing
  anywhere to say so.
- **It will build.** A value that is not a number, a graphic name with a quote in
  it, a wind command an argument short or one smashline never wrapped, two moves
  whose names differ only by punctuation and collapse onto one function —
  anything that produces a well-formed but broken mod is caught here rather than
  by your toolchain.
- **It is not wasteful.** A call issued twice in one block, an empty block, a
  `wait(0)`, a collision cleared before it comes out. These only inform.
- **It does not lose anything.** An effect script is regenerated from the calls
  Visionary understands, so a line it has no editor field for used to be dropped.
  Most are now copied through instead, in position, still inside whatever `if`
  they were written in — a costume-specific recolour stays specific to that
  costume. What is copied is listed too, because a copied line is not an
  understood one: editing the move around it will not update it, and it has to be
  valid Rust on its own. The few lines that genuinely cannot be kept are named
  individually, with the exact text and how many times it goes.

A branch of the move's own — an `if(WorkModule::is_flag(…)){`, its `else` — is
kept whole, condition and closing brace included, and the lines inside it stay
inside it. A hitbox written under one still shows on the timeline, because the
editor cannot know which way the branch will go and hiding it would be worse;
editing that hitbox rewrites it where it is.

The timing checks are skipped for a script carrying branches of its own, or an
`FT_MOTION_RATE`. Those decide at runtime what runs and when, the editor does
not model them, and a warning that guesses is worse than no warning at all.
Everything else is checked either way. Effect timing can be synced into source
when the call sits in a flat, isolated frame block; ambiguous layouts are
reported instead of guessed.

Write-back rewrites argument *values* and bounded, unambiguous effect timing
blocks: the macros you called, your comments, and your formatting all stay
exactly as written. A one-shot moves its start block; a following effect or
trail moves its uniquely paired finite stop as well. Every property the hitbox
and effect panels expose is covered — the masks, the sound and collision
attributes, the flags, the capsule endpoints — so an edit either lands in the
file or is named in the report under the editor. It is never dropped quietly.

Live effect retiming uses the same one-based script frames as the editor,
including frame 1. A timing edit received after its requested frame is reported
as missed for the current playback; the authored effect remains visible and the
exact replacement is applied on the next playback instead of appearing late.

Grab boxes are read and written as the `CATCH` calls they are, so a grab in your
script shows up on the timeline and can be retuned like any other collision. The
status kind and situation mask are not editable properties, and your own values
for them are carried through untouched.

A hitbox keeps the macro it was written as. `ATTACK` and `ATTACK_IGNORE_THROW`
carry the same arguments but are not the same call — the second one still hits a
fighter who is already being thrown — so the **Macro** dropdown in the hitbox
properties says which one this is, and exports and live previews fire the one you
picked. Switching between them is a change of macro rather than of value, so it
lands in an export but is reported when syncing into your own source.

Wind areas are written back too. The four `AREA_WIND_2ND` commands share their
first eight arguments and nothing else — the ninth is the rectangle's height and
the radial call's lifetime — so each is matched and retuned only against calls of
its own command, and a rectangular value can never land in a radial one. The
lifetime is an argument, so dragging it moves the timeline bar with it and lands
in the file; the shorter commands have no lifetime and run until an
`AreaModule::erase_wind`, whose frame is a different line and so is reported
rather than moved. Switching an area between rectangular and radial is a change
of command, not of value, so it lands in an export and is reported on source sync.

An effect's playback rate is the `LAST_EFFECT_SET_RATE` line beneath its spawn.
That macro names no effect — it changes whatever spawned last — so the rate is
shown as a property of the spawn above it and travels with that spawn when you
disable or move it. The **Rate** checkbox is the difference between no rate line
at all and one that happens to say 1.0; turning it on or off adds or removes a
call, so it lands in an export but is reported when syncing into your own
source, while changing an existing rate is written straight into the file. A
rate that does not sit directly beneath a spawn Visionary recognises is left
alone rather than attached to whichever spawn came before it.

**Tint** and **Opacity** are the `LAST_EFFECT_SET_COLOR` and
`LAST_EFFECT_SET_ALPHA` lines, and behave the same way: a colour picker and a
drag beside their own checkboxes, belonging to one spawn rather than to an
effect kind. The drag fields are not clamped to the picker's range, because the
vanilla scripts write colours brighter than white. If a live colour multiplier is
set on the same effect, that multiplier is what ships and the report says so —
rather than both being written and the second quietly winning, which is what
happened before.

These lines are also why a move can preview right and export wrong. Because they
name no effect, one sitting behind an `if` is separated from the spawn it
modifies, and Visionary will not guess which spawn that was. Nearly every vanilla
use is of exactly that kind — a costume check wrapped around a recolour — so
those are listed under the generated code as lines the export drops, not attached
to whichever spawn happens to be nearest.

That list now also reaches the export itself. It used to appear only under the
generated code in the editor, which meant it was shown while the move was open
and nowhere else — exporting a project you had reopened told you nothing, because
the dropped lines are the one thing a saved project did not remember and the
export had no way to mention them if it had. Both halves are fixed: a move
carries its dropped lines in the project file, and the export summary prints them
under the line that says what was written. If an export is going to leave
something out, it says so at the moment it happens.

What it says is a snapshot from when the move was last read. Open the move and it
is re-derived; leave it closed and export, and you get what was true when you
saved. That is the honest reading of a note about a script the project no longer
has.

The same list is written into the exported mod's `README.md`, under a heading
naming the lines that were left out. The status line is not a place a warning can
live: it holds one line, and on a mod-folder export the plugin build finishes a
few seconds later and writes its own result over the top. So the summary is where
you notice, and the file beside the mod is where you can go back and look.

Throws carry a hit with no volume. `ATTACK_ABS` sets the damage and knockback
applied to an opponent who is *already* caught, so it has no bone, no size, and
no position — the fields that would describe those are hidden rather than shown
as zeros, and it draws on the timeline but never in the viewport. What it does
have is the outcome it describes, shown as **Applies to**: a catch, a throw, or
a fighter-specific kind such as Terry's final smash. Two of these often sit in
one block naming the same id and differing only in that, so they are matched on
the kind and never on the id.

Intangibility is available in the **Hurtboxes** tab. The **Advanced authored hurtbox commands**
section contains the source-level state list. `HIT_NODE`
and `HIT_NO` set how one bone or one numbered hurtbox group receives hits, and
`WHOLE_HIT` sets every bone at once — shown as **all bones**, with no target to
pick because the macro has none. The game holds that setting until something
takes it back, so a state is shown as the span between the call that sets it and
the call that restores it, rather than as two unrelated lines you have to pair up
by eye. `HIT_RESET_ALL` ends every one of them at once. Changing a status or a
bone is a value edit and is written into your source; adding or removing a call,
or moving one to a different frame, is structure and so lands in an export and is
reported when syncing.

A `WHOLE_HIT` span is tracked separately from the per-bone ones, so setting the
whole body translucent will not appear to end a `HIT_NODE` state that is open at
the same time. In the game it does cover those bones. No vanilla script mixes the
two — every use of `WHOLE_HIT` in the archive stands alone, in final-smash and
thrown states — so there was nothing to calibrate the interaction against, and
showing a span the script does not describe would be a worse guess than showing
none. If you mix them yourself, read the two as independent.

`COL_PRI` sits in the same section, and is the odd one out there. It ranks a
fighter's colour blend against the others applied at the same moment — it is a
`FLASH`-family command rather than a hurtbox one — and it is ended by
`COL_NORMAL`, not by `HIT_RESET_ALL`. They are separate resets of separate
things, so one is never used to close the other. It appears among the hurtboxes
because that is where a `game_` script's statements are edited; in an `effect_`
script the pair is edited with the colour commands below.

The **Hurtboxes** tab in the right sidebar contains the **Hurtboxes in viewport** checkbox and shows the selected
fighter's real parameter-defined capsules. It is off by default and remembers
your preference between sessions and fighters. The overlay uses unambiguous
state names and colors: **NORMAL** is light gray, **INVINCIBLE** is cyan,
**XLU / INTANGIBLE** is amber, and **OFF** is hidden. Super armor is violet,
reaction-value armor blue, damage-based armor orange, and damage-count armor
pink; unknown modes use a magenta outline. The underlying hurtbox color remains
visible so both conditions can be read at once. A fighter or mod without
readable parameter data cannot provide this overlay, and any skipped or
unresolved parameter entries are reported in the checkbox tooltip rather than
replaced with guessed geometry.

The **Parameter hurtboxes** list in this tab lets you select an individual
capsule by its `HIT_NO` parameter-list index and bone. Choose **NORMAL**,
**INVINCIBLE**, **XLU / INTANGIBLE**, or **OFF**, enter one-based start and end
frames, and select **Apply / replace range**. The editor writes a targeted
`HIT_NO` at the start and restores that capsule's own parameter default on the
following frame. Applying another range to the same capsule replaces the
previous editor range instead of stacking duplicate commands. The same schedule
drives the viewport, timeline, project/export output, linked source write-back,
and live preview. Expand **Advanced authored hurtbox commands** only when you
need to edit existing `HIT_NODE`, `HIT_NO`, `WHOLE_HIT`, reset, priority, or
damage-reaction source commands; unknown values stay visible instead of being
guessed.

Effect calls that use the game's explicit `null` graphic remain in the effect
list and timeline as **No effect (null placeholder)** entries. They have no
viewport marker because the source call does not spawn a graphic; selecting the
entry still lets you inspect or replace its source values.

The **Hurtboxes** tab also edits fighter-wide damage-reaction conditions. Use the
**Fighter-wide damage reaction** controls to choose normal reaction, super armor,
reaction-value armor, damage-based armor, damage-count armor, or the explicit
no-reaction mode, enter its value when applicable, and select **Apply / replace
armor range**. Applying another range replaces the previous editor range, and
normal reaction is restored automatically on the following frame. These
conditions use distinct outlines (violet, blue, orange, pink, or magenta for an
unknown mode) over the selected hurtbox colors, and the schedule is preserved in
the project, generated export, linked source, and live preview.

**Active hitbox changes** is the section below that, for the two commands that retune a
hitbox which is *already out*. `ATK_POWER` re-sets a box's damage and
`ATK_SET_SHIELD_SETOFF_MUL` scales the shield push-off it applies; each names the
hitbox id it acts on, and each runs on its own frame. That frame is the reason
they are their own rows rather than extra fields on the hitbox: a script may tune
a box in the same breath as creating it, or five frames later once it is already
hitting, and only a separate line can say the second. Editing the id or the value
is written into your source; moving one to another frame, or turning it into the
other command, is structure and lands in an export instead. A row shows a small
amber marker if it names an id this move never opens — the call is then retuning
nothing, which the script itself gives no sign of.

Two commands that look like they belong here do not. `ATK_HIT_ABS` and
`ATK_LERP_RATIO` name no hitbox id, so there is nothing for them to modify; every
vanilla `ATK_HIT_ABS` also passes local variables rather than values, so there is
nothing to edit either. Both are carried through an export exactly as written.

**Detection boxes** — `SEARCH` — are collisions that hit nothing. A search volume
has the same geometry a grab box does, and it is drawn in amber to keep that
distinction visible: it looks like a hitbox and cannot damage anyone. What it
*does* is report that something is inside it, and what the fighter does about
that lives in the status code, which no ACMD script can reach. Kirby's inhale is
the clearest example — a grab box, a detection box and the swallow's damage all
come out in the same frame, all three numbered 0.

Alongside the geometry you can edit what the volume looks for and which hurtbox
states count as found. Note that these use the `HIT_STATUS_MASK_*` constants,
which are a different set from the `HIT_STATUS_*` states in the hurtbox section
above and overlap them numerically — `HIT_STATUS_MASK_NORMAL` is 1, the same
number as `HIT_STATUS_INVINCIBLE`. They are different arguments to different
commands; the editor keeps them apart and so should you.

Nothing ends a search volume, so one has no end frame: there is no macro that
takes it back, and the two vanilla scripts that do close one close it from the
status code. A box therefore runs to the end of the move, which is what the
script actually says rather than a frame invented for the timeline.

`SEARCH` is written two ways in the game's own scripts — with and without its
three capsule-endpoint arguments — and four of the seven vanilla calls use the
shorter one. Adding a capsule to a call written without the slots needs three new
arguments rather than a changed one, so that edit is reported and lands in an
export instead of being written into your source. `SET_SEARCH_SIZE_EXIST`, which
re-sizes a box already out, is not modelled: it belongs with the hitbox tuning
above rather than here, and no vanilla script uses it.

**Move sounds** get their own band at the bottom of the timeline, one row per call,
each a tick at the frame it fires on with the sound's name beside it. A move's
`sound_` script is read alongside its hitboxes and effects, so you can see the
swing that goes with a hitbox, the footsteps a run plays, and the landing thud
that lands well after the last hitbox closed — the timeline widens to fit that
last one rather than cutting it off. `STOP_SE` is drawn in a colder colour,
because it silences a sound rather than playing one.

A sound is a tick and not a bar on purpose: the script says when one starts and
nothing in ACMD says when it ends.

A **Move sounds** section in **Sound & feedback** lists the same calls with the sound name
editable, so you can give a punch a heavier impact or swap a fighter's footsteps
for someone else's. The name is a label in the fighter's own sound bank; one the
bank does not have plays nothing rather than reporting an error, so a typo is
silent in game as well as here. Exact in-place name changes are previewed live
when their original call can be identified safely, and all edits reach the
generated `sound_` function and the linked source report.

The section also offers **Move here**, **Remove**, and **Add sound**. A flat call can
move between frame blocks; calls inside loops or runtime branches can be removed
as authored, but are not retimed because that would change their control flow.
Adding, removing, and retiming are structural: generated export applies them,
linked-source sync reports them instead of guessing, and the live plugin applies
safe flat changes by suppressing the original call and injecting the edited call
at its new frame. Name-only changes continue to use argument overrides. A
symbolic or malformed suppression-window tail remains source/export-only so the
base call is not silenced without a complete typed replacement. `SET_PLAY_INHIVIT`'s
suppression window is shown beside its call and is not editable.

The complete edited `sound_` tree is saved in `modproject.json`, including the
unknown lines around calls and an intentional empty replacement when every call
was removed. Loading a project stages every saved sound and expression script
before publishing the final live-rule union, so a move that has not been edited
does not replace the fighter's own category script. Structural sound suppression
and injection rules are included in that same coalesced project-import batch.

**Expression scripts** share the **Sound & feedback** tab. Measured `RUMBLE_HIT`,
`QUAKE`, `FT_ATTACK_ABS_CAMERA_QUAKE`, and `ControlModule::set_rumble` calls can
be retimed, added, removed, and have their authored arguments edited. Each call shows its
editable values directly in one compact row: rumble presets use a searchable selector, camera
kinds use named selectors, numeric values use drag controls, and the direct controller-rumble
repeat flag is a checkbox. `RUMBLE_HIT` has a preset plus a game-defined integer; that integer is
shown as **Value** rather than being given a misleading profile or duration name. Direct
`ControlModule::set_rumble` has a preset, native duration, repeat flag, and target. A captured
zero duration remains `0 · preset` and is passed through as authored; it does not disable rumble.
Unrecognized project-local tokens retain a compact source-expression fallback, and changed calls
offer Reset values without hiding the controls behind nested panels.
Unknown lines remain visible in the generated/source paths. Flat structural edits suppress
the measured base call and inject the typed replacement during live replay when a
safe identity and argument vector are available; generated export still writes the
complete edited function, and linked-source sync reports structural operations
rather than guessing at a user's source layout. Loop/branch retimes, unmeasured
calls, and ambiguous source tokens remain export/source-only.

Selecting a hitbox in the collision list, timeline, or viewport gives it the
same bright outline while retaining its attack, grab, search, or wind family
color. Selection is presentation state only: it does not change project data,
generated source, or live rules.

**Motion & state commands** appear in their own timeline lanes and in the
matching editor tab:

- `REVERSE_LR` places or removes a facing-direction change.
- `SET_SPEED` edits the direct x/y velocity written at a point.
- `SET_SPEED_EX` edits the x/y velocity written to the selected kinetic reserve.
- `ADD_SPEED_NO_LIMIT` edits an x/y velocity addition.
- `CORRECT` edits the ground-correction kind while preserving named source constants.
- `FT_CATCH_STOP` edits its two numeric catch-stop values.
- `FT_START_ADJUST_MOTION_FRAME_arg1` edits the numeric motion-frame adjustment.
- `CLR_SPEED` edits the authored kinetic-reserve ID token.
- `SET_AIR` places, moves, or removes the point that switches the fighter to air kinetics.
- `KineticModule::change_kinetic` edits the authored kinetic-type token.
- `KineticModule::suspend_energy`, `resume_energy`, `enable_energy`, and `unable_energy` edit
  the authored energy-ID token.
- `KineticModule::add_speed` edits the x/y components of the supported zero-z velocity vector.
- `KineticModule::clear_speed_all` places, moves, or removes the measured argument-less speed-clear point.
- `KineticModule::set_consider_ground_friction` edits the ground-friction toggle and authored reserve-attribute token.
- `MotionModule::set_rate` edits the whole animation's playback rate.
- `MotionModule::set_helper_calculation` edits the direct helper-calculation toggle.
- `MotionModule::set_rate_partial` edits the playback rate of a named partial-animation part while preserving that part token.
- `MotionModule::set_frame_partial` edits the seek frame and `sync` flag of a named partial-animation part. The native binding uses `sync = true` when the source omits that optional argument; linked-source sync preserves the original three- or four-argument spelling.
- `WorkModule::on_flag` and `WorkModule::off_flag` edit the authored flag token for the supported direct calls.
- `WorkModule::enable_transition_term`, `unable_transition_term`, `enable_transition_term_group`, and `unable_transition_term_group_ex` edit the authored transition-term or group token for the supported direct calls.
- `WorkModule::inc_int` increments the named stored integer counter.
- `WorkModule::set_int` and `WorkModule::set_float` edit the authored value and WorkModule slot tokens for the supported direct calls.

**Work flags** is the engine's accurate name for named on/off values stored for
a fighter. Move and status scripts use them to remember or signal conditions,
such as enabling a combo or marking a move phase; the authored flag name tells
you the exact purpose. Nearby **Allowed state transitions**, **Increment stored
counter**, and **Stored script values** sections expose the corresponding
WorkModule state without hiding its native command name.

Value controls edit their point values while keeping their source frame. Placement
controls such as `REVERSE_LR` and `SET_AIR` change a point's presence or frame.
Named
`CORRECT` constants can be exported and written back to a linked source project;
live correction changes require a numeric capture so Visionary can identify the
call safely. `CLR_SPEED` keeps named source tokens for export and source sync;
its live replacement is available only when a numeric capture identifies the
kinetic reserve. `SET_AIR` presence and placement are structural edits: the
generated export applies them freely, while linked-source sync edits only a
verified flat call layout and reports branches, loops, or ambiguous sites.
`KineticModule::clear_speed_all` is also a structural presence/frame edit; source sync preserves
the verified standard or HDR receiver and reports unsupported layouts.
`KineticModule::set_consider_ground_friction` preserves its named reserve token in exported and
linked source, while live value edits require a numeric capture of the original toggle and
attribute. Its presence and frame are structural edits with the same flat-source sync boundary.
The direct `KineticModule` controls preserve named source tokens for export and
source sync; their live replacements require a numeric capture of the original
energy or kinetic value. The supported `add_speed` shape keeps `z` at `0.0` and
only exposes x/y for editing.
`MotionModule::set_rate` and `MotionModule::set_rate_partial` accept zero in exported
source, while live replacements require a finite positive captured rate. The partial
part token is preserved for export and source sync; changing it or changing the call's
structure is reported rather than guessed. `MotionModule::set_helper_calculation`
source sync changes only an existing boolean argument. Partial-frame edits require a unique
numeric capture of the original part and seek frame for live replay; changing the source
part, frame placement, or optional-argument arity is reported rather than guessed. Status/getter
kinetic calls that are not shown remain preserved in the source and are not rewritten
until their complete source and runtime signatures are verified. Direct `WorkModule` flag
controls preserve numeric and dereferenced source tokens in export and source sync; live
replacement requires a numeric capture of the original flag and a numeric replacement.
Direct `WorkModule` transition-term and transition-term-group controls preserve numeric and
dereferenced source tokens in export and source sync; live replacement requires a numeric capture
of the original term or group token and a numeric replacement. Direct `WorkModule` value setters preserve numeric and dereferenced value
and slot tokens in export and source sync; live replacement requires a numeric capture of the
original value and slot and numeric replacements. The operation, frame, receiver, and call
structure remain source/export-owned.
Malformed calls, symbolic-only live values, duplicate same-frame identities, and structural
changes remain source/export-only. Movement changes are not simulated in the desktop viewport;
connect the Skyline plugin or export the project to apply them in game.

`FLASH`, `COL_NORMAL` and the `BURN_COLOR` family tint the fighter's model or the screen
flash. They sit in the effect list beside the spawns, but they are not spawns:
there is no graphic, joint, or position, so those fields are hidden and a colour
picker takes their place. **Add colour command** creates one. The vanilla scripts
almost always use them in pairs — one call that snaps to a colour, and a `_FRAME`
one directly after that fades the blend in or out over a number of frames — and
both halves are editable. Changing values writes them into your source; switching
which command a call is changes how many arguments it takes, so that lands in an
export and is reported when syncing.

Spawn commands have the same flexibility. Select **Spawn command** on an effect event to move
between the supported `EFFECT`, follow, flip, alpha, colour, attribute, contact, random, and
no-stop families. The editor keeps the graphic transform, adds or removes the second flip
graphic as needed, updates the event lifetime, and supplies safe defaults for the target
command's private arguments. Compatible hidden tail values are retained when the two commands
share the same verified argument shape. The selected command is used by both live preview and
the generated ACMD export; **Sync Edits Into Source** reports the command swap because changing
an ACMD macro's structure is outside its positional value-only write-back boundary.

Three of them take no arguments at all — `COL_NORMAL`, `BURN_COLOR_NORMAL` and
`START_INFO_FLASH_EYE` are resets, and there is nothing in them to change. They
still appear in the list, because where a reset sits is the whole of what it
does: dragging it later leaves the tint on screen for longer, and disabling it
leaves the tint on for good.

Before this they were dropped: the effect export regenerates the whole function
from the calls it knows about, so every exported move lost its colouring without
saying so.

A spawn written inside a condition keeps it. Several fighters spawn one graphic
facing left and a different one facing right, or recolour an effect once per
costume; the export reproduces the check around the call rather than flattening
it, so the move still does one thing at a time instead of all of them at once.
Lines the editor has no field for ride along beside the call they followed, which
matters because a `LAST_EFFECT_SET_COLOR` recolours whatever spawned last — moved
even a little, it lands on the wrong effect. The effect panel shows these under
**Kept as written**.

Anything that cannot be written as a value change to an existing argument or a
safe timing-block move is reported instead of guessed at: a spawn you added or
removed, a graphic you renamed, a branch or loop, a frame collision, an
ambiguous or missing stop pairing, structural stop creation/removal, or a sword
trail's transform — a trail is drawn between the joints it names and has no
transform arguments. **Sync Edits Into Source**, in the **Mod** menu, applies
the same write-back to the file directly, for when the source window is not
open.

A category your project does not have yet is created the first time you edit it.
Most projects define only what they change — a hitbox mod has a `game_` function
and nothing else — but the editor shows you all four categories, filling the
missing ones from vanilla, so it is easy to edit a sound or an effect in a move
whose file has nowhere to put it. That function is now written for you, next to
the rest of the move, and registered the way the project registers its own
scripts. What gets written is vanilla's own text with your edit applied to it,
not a regenerated copy, so the rest of the function is byte for byte what the
game shipped.

A move you have not edited is never written this way, and a project that says
nothing at all about the fighter is still left alone — there is no file to add to
and no way to tell which character it would belong to. If the project registers
its scripts in some way Visionary cannot read, the function is still written and
the status line says it could not be registered, because a script the game never
installs looks exactly like one that does nothing.

## Projects and mod exports

The **Project Hub** appears on launch — **Resume last / New / Open
(`modproject.json`) / Import mod / Recent / Browse without project** — and
reopens from **File → Project Hub** mid-session. One current project holds
every edit: its path is remembered, **Save** (`Ctrl+S`) writes silently,
**Save As** relocates, and Export/Load adopt the path they touched. Switching
projects with unsaved edits warns first.

The **Mod** menu keeps hitbox, effect-spawn, authored effect, texture, and
transplant edits together:

- **Save / Save As** writes the current `modproject.json` silently (or asks once
  when it has no file yet). If imported texture images are used, keep the
  generated asset folder beside the JSON file.
- **Export Project** writes a portable `modproject.json` and adopts its path.
  These editable files are exported separately from mod and developer files.
- **Load Project** replaces the current project, restores every edit, and sends
  the available live rules and effects to a connected game. Added or retimed
  move events may ask you to perform that move once so the plugin can capture
  the original arguments safely.
- **Import Mod as Project** adopts any mod folder: `ui_chara_db` diffs
  (order/visibility/row fields), `.xmsbt` names, BNTX portraits→PNG assets, and
  `fighter_param` diffs become editable; source text is copied as reference and
  loose assets stay linked via the mod library. Compiled ACMD, binary
  EFF/MSBT, and `.nro` plugins are reference-only by design, unknown roster
  rows are reported never fabricated, and missing base dumps skip their diff
  honestly. Every file is accounted for in the import report.
- **Export Mod Folder** creates one complete ARCropolis mod directory. Copy that
  directory into `<SD root>/ultimate/mods/`. Rebuilt effects are under `effect/`,
  and the built ACMD plugin is chainloaded from `plugin.nro` at the root of the
  same mod.
- **Export Developer Files** writes rebuilt effect files to `effect_mod/` and
  the buildable Rust ACMD project to `acmd_source/`.
