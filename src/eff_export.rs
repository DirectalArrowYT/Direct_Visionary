// Mod export: rebuild an ef_*.eff with the project's authored edits applied, using the
// effect_library crate (byte-exact writer). The in-tree parser (src/effects.rs) is the
// EDITOR's view; this module maps its edited fields onto effect_library's structs:
//
//   emission_rate → Emission.rate            lifetime      → ParticleData.life (i32)
//   scale         → ParticleScale.scale_x/y/z (ratio vs scale_x, preserves anisotropy)
//   color_scale   → EmitterStatic.color_scale emitter_scale → EmitterInfo.scale_x/y/z
//   color0/color1 → whichever source `effects.rs` READ for this emitter, at the same
//                   precedence: a Constant ParticleColor, else the EmitterStatic key table
//                   (key.x/y/z = r/g/b; times untouched), else the EmitterInfo static color
//   alpha0        → EmitterStatic.alpha0 keys (value in key.x), else a Constant
//                   ParticleColor.alpha0, else EmitterInfo.color0_a — same rule
//
// Writes are strictly scoped: one AuthoredEdit names ONE emitter set and ONE emitter, and
// touches only that emitter's LIVE key slots. Every other emitter, channel and inert key
// slot stays byte-identical to the source — see the
// `authored_color_edit_touches_only_the_targeted_emitter` regression test.
//
// Edited emitters get `cached_binary` cleared — the serializer prefers the cached EMTR
// blob and would otherwise silently drop the edits.
