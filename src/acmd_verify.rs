//! Verification of the Rust that Visionary generates.
//!
//! Every export runs through here before anything is written. The point is not to re-state
//! what the emitter meant to do — that would only agree with itself — but to *read the code
//! back* the same way the editor reads a user's own script, and check that what comes out is
//! what the user specified. Everything in this module is derived from the emitted text, not
//! from the emitter's intentions.
//!
//! Four properties are checked, in the order a failure matters:
//!
//! 1. **It is Rust.** Every generated `.rs` file is parsed with `syn`. Raw script lines and
//!    recorded macro tails are spliced into the output verbatim, so this is not a formality.
//! 2. **It says what the user said.** Each emitted function is re-parsed by the editor's own
//!    parser and the resulting hitboxes, hurtbox states, and effect calls are compared field by
//!    field with the ones the user edited. A single rounded decimal is a finding.
//! 3. **It will compile and run.** Values that produce a well-formed but broken call — a
//!    non-finite float, a graphic name with a quote in it, a wind command with the wrong
//!    number of arguments — are caught here rather than by the user's toolchain, or worse, by
//!    the game.
//! 4. **It is not wasteful.** Empty blocks, dead statements, and calls the game will never
//!    reach are reported so the generated file stays worth reading.
//! 5. **It does not lose anything.** The effect export rebuilds the function out of the calls
//!    it recognises, so a line it has no variant for is deleted rather than kept. Each one is
//!    named against the script it came from.
//!
//! Anything in class 1–3 is a [`Severity::Blocker`] and fails the export outright: a mod that
//! does not compile, or that quietly ships different numbers from the ones on screen, is worse
//! than no mod. Classes 4 and 5 are a [`Severity::Warning`] and only inform — see
//! [`check_dropped_lines`] for why a real loss is not allowed to fail an export.
