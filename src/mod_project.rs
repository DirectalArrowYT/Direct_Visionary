// Unified mod project: every edit the toolkit makes — hitboxes/ACMD scripts, effect-call
// (spawn) edits, authored .eff value edits, effect transplants — in one serializable file.
// This file travels WITH exported mods so a mod can be re-opened for further editing.
//
// Two distinct concepts live near each other here and must not be conflated:
//   * TRANSPLANT — copying an emitter set out of a donor .eff into a fighter's .eff.
//     That's the operation; see `TransplantOp`.
//   * ONE-SLOT — scoping an edit so it only applies to specific costume/skin slots
//     (c00, c07, c12, c50 …; NOT limited to 0–7). That's a modifier, expressed as
//     `TransplantOp::one_slot_slots`, and it can ride on top of a transplant.
