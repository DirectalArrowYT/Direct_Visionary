// Eff editor: browse ef_*.eff game dumps, edit authored emitter values against a pristine
// snapshot, and preview the edit live in game through the slight_replica plugin.
//
// HOW AUTHORED EDITS REACH THE GAME
// Authored PTCL values are PER EMITTER. The runtime modifier protocol is not: the plugin's
// `rainbow.color` / `scale` are pinned on an `EffectData` for a whole effect KIND, so there
// is no wire message that can say "tint only emitter 3". Deriving a multiplier from the
// authored delta therefore cannot be made correct — the old code averaged every emitter's
// colour ratio into one kind-level value, which recoloured the ENTIRE effect whenever you
// edited a single emitter (and silently ignored color1 edits entirely).
//
// So authored edits do NOT go on the modifier wire at all. They are baked into the LIVE
// CARRIER: the edited effect is cloned into a borrowed assist eff, the edits are written into
// that clone (per-emitter exact, the same writer the exporter uses), and the original kind is
// aliased onto it. The fighter's own eff is not a candidate — `reparse_game_path` rebuilds the
// parsed structs from the resident buffer and never re-requests the file, so edited bytes went
// unread mid-match. The editor only raises a request flag; the app owns the rebuild.
//
// Transplants, per-emitter texture swaps and whole-texture PNG imports all ride that same
// rebuild, so one Send ships everything the project says.
//
// The kind-level multipliers are still exposed, but only as their own honest feature: the
// "Kind look — color × / speed ×" panel, which the user drives directly and which is
// documented as applying to every spawn of the effect.
