//! Emitting the roster into a mod folder.
//!
//! Two rules shape this module, both of them consequences of the project being **sparse**:
//!
//!  * The roster database is rebuilt from *base + overrides* on every export, never from a
//!    stored copy. A project therefore stays correct when the mods underneath it change, and
//!    an export never resurrects a base file from whenever the edit happened to be made.
//!  * Anything that could not be written is **reported by name**. An export that quietly drops
//!    an override the user made is the failure this whole module is arranged to avoid: the
//!    project still contains the edit, the mod does not, and nothing said so.
